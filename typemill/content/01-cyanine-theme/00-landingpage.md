# The Landingpage

Cyanine provides an optional landingpage with six segments:

* **Intro** with the content of the home page and an additional link/button.
* **Info** with individual markdown content.
* **Teaser** with two elements. Each element has a headline, a text and a link/button.
* **Contrast** with a headline, text-input and a link/button. The colors are inverted.
* **Navigation** with the whole content of the website. You can change the depth of the navigation.
* **News** with a link to a news-folder. It will display the three latest news in a card-design. Add a hero-image to each news-entry to show a teaser image.

You can activate or deactivate the whole landingpage, order all elements and enable/disable each element individually.
